AW-Fulfilment reviews its prices and other charges regularly and may change the Charges at any time subject to AW-Fulfilment notifying you by not less than one (1) months’ notice via email. The new Charges shall apply at the beginning of the calendar month following the expiry of such notice.</p><p>5.2. AW-Fulfilment may include in the Charges from time to time, additional costs incurred by AW-Fulfilment as a result of (i) any change in carrier, delivery, collection or storage requirements and which arise as a result of any request or action on the part of the Customer or due to the failure of the Customer to provide adequate or correct information and instructions, or comply with its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) deliveries to certain territories; (iii) Goods returned to AW-Fulfilment by Recipients; or (iv) any cost factors beyond its control including any increase in the national minimum wage and fuel and other surcharges imposed by its carrier(s) used for the Services and any increase in any carrier’s charges resulting from a change in applicable law.</p><p>5.3. AW-Fulfilment may review and change the Charges if you do not use the Services at the volumes contained in the initial agreement (or other applicable Document) or as set out in clause 6 or if you materially change any processes (including packing) or requirements from those notified to AW-Fulfilment before the commencement of the Services and/or contained in the Documents.</p><p>5.4. AW-Fulfilment will invoice you for all Charges and any other payments due under this Agreement monthly in arrears.

All Charges are exclusive of VAT (or equivalent sales tax) and you must pay the same to AW-Fulfilment subject to receipt of a valid VAT invoice.</p><p>5.5. You shall pay all sums that you owe to AW-Fulfilment under these Terms without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding of any kind, save as may be required by law.</p><p>5.6. AW-Fulfilment reserves the right to suspend or terminate the provision of the Services to you immediately if you are in default of payment of invoices or any other sum due, for more than seven (7) days after the due date. Such suspension or termination does not limit its other rights and remedies.</p><p>5.7. AW-Fulfilment shall have a general and particular lien (on its own behalf and as agent for any assignee of its invoices) on the Goods in its possession as security for payment of all sums claimed by AW-Fulfilment from you. The Charges shall continue to accrue on any Goods detained under lien. If an invoice for the Charges is not paid in full on its due date for payment, AW-Fulfilment may, without prejudice to its other rights and remedies, give notice in writing to you of its intention to sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of the Goods in its possession if the amount outstanding is not paid in full within fourteen (14) days. If the amount due is not paid by the expiry of such period, AW-Fulfilment may sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of the Goods in its possession, as agent of you and at your expense and risk and shall remit the proceeds of sale or disposal of such Goods to you after deduction of all amounts due to AW-Fulfilment and the expenses incurred by AW-Fulfilment for the sale or disposal of the Goods. AW-Fulfilment shall be entitled to sell Goods at such price (if any) as it considers appropriate. AW-Fulfilment shall not be liable for any alleged failure to achieve a sufficient sale price for the Goods. AW-Fulfilment (and any person deriving title to products through it) shall be entitled to use under licence in connection with the disposal of Goods any copyright material or trademarks, and pass on any manufacturer’s standard warranty, relating to them which would be available to an authorised retailer of the Goods. This clause shall survive termination of these Terms.</p><p>5.8. You shall notify AW-Fulfilment promptly should a query or dispute arise on any invoice upon presentation and AW-Fulfilment will endeavour to answer any such query or resolve any such dispute within three (3) Business Days. Queries or disputes must be reasonable and raised in good faith. Where any dispute is not resolved in time, you shall pay the undisputed part of any invoices in accordance with these Terms.</p><p>6. TERMINATION</p><p>6.1. Either Party may terminate the provision of the Services under these Terms by providing the other Party with at least one (1) months’ notice of termination in writing.</p><p>6.2. You may (without prejudice to any other right or remedy you may have under these Terms or otherwise) immediately terminate the provision of the Services under these Terms by giving notice in writing to AW-Fulfilment without any further liability to AW-Fulfilment where the reason for the termination is:</p><p>6.2.1. a material breach by AW-Fulfilment of these Terms and (if the breach is capable of remedy) AW-Fulfilment fails to remedy the breach within 28 days of receipt of written notice from you to do so (or 7 days in the case of non-payment of Charges); or</p><p>6.2.2. AW-Fulfilment becoming subject to Insolvency Proceedings; or</p><p>6.2.3. AW-Fulfilment ceasing, or threatening to cease, to carry on business; or</p><p>6.3. AW-Fulfilment may (without prejudice to any other right or remedy it may have under these Terms or otherwise) suspend the Services temporarily without notice for a period not exceeding 28 days (although you remains liable to pay all Charges during such suspension), or terminate the provision of the Services under these Terms by immediate notice in writing without any further liability to you where the reason for the termination is:</p><p>6.3.1. a material breach by you or anyone else under your control, with or without your knowledge or approval, of these Terms and (if the breach is capable of remedy) you fail to remedy the breach within 28 days of receipt of written notice from AW-Fulfilment to do so; or</p><p>6.3.2. you become subject to Insolvency Proceedings; or</p><p>6.3.3. you cease, or threatening to cease, to carry on business; or</p><p>6.4. AW-Fulfilment’s election to suspend the Services does not affect its right to terminate the provision of the Services under these Terms.</p><p>6.5. In the event of termination of the provision of the Services under these Terms for any reason whatsoever:</p><p>6.5.2. AW-Fulfilment shall ensure that Goods are stored so that they are identifiable by you or your nominee as belonging to you;</p><p>6.5.3. Subject to paying all arrears on your account, you (or your nominee) may, after giving at least 72 hours’ notice to AW-Fulfilment, and by arranging a suitable appointment, collect your Goods during Working Hours from our Warehouse location; and</p><p>6.5.4. you shall arrange within 14 days of termination for the removal and carriage of all your Property from the Warehouse. Such removal and carriage shall be at your expense, unless the provision of the Services under these Terms is terminated pursuant to clause 6.2, in which case the reasonable cost shall be borne by AW-Fulfilment to an on-shore destination in the same country only. If your Property is not removed with this 14 day period, AW-Fulfilment may dispose of, sell or keep it at its discretion, and in the case of sale, the terms of clause 5.7 shall apply. For certain Goods, AW-Fulfilment may wish to expedite removal and carriage of all or certain of your Property from the Warehouse in which case AW-Fulfilment shall notify you (including by email) and if the relevant Property is not removed within three (3) Business Days of notification, AW-Fulfilment may sell it (including by auction) in which case, the terms of clause 5.7 relating to sale shall apply.</p><p>6.6.
