Founded in 1995 AW has grown to actively supply over 50,000 gift shops across the UK and Europe. In 2020 at the height of the pandemic (and during the busiest ever month) &nbsp;a freak accident caused a fire that destroyed the main AW warehouse in the UK. Fortunately no-one was harmed but the resulting renewal inspired a bold move to a new warehouse almost 400% larger.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Affinity Park became the new HQ of AW with an investment in a huge 6000 pallet space racking and state of the art systems enabling AW to expand and offer our customers more than ever before. &nbsp;<a class="_str_" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Piab5j3WayQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Check it out here.</a></p><br><p>At AW our vision is to take the opportunity to leverage this extra capacity to develop collaborative trading relationships that may lead to mutually &nbsp;beneficial situations.</p><br><p>For example if you chose AW as your storage distribution partner, maybe via our drop shipping programme (or even direct supply) we can enable your products to be exposed to our comprehensive database of UK and EU customers. &nbsp;There are endless possibilities, why not chat with James the fulfilment manager today.&nbsp;</p><br><p>We recommend that you register with us first - click the link above right, and James (or team member) will call you, or if you are in a mad rush.. you can reach out to James at info@aw-fulfilment.co.uk or call direct on: 07377 188 459 &nbsp;</p><br><p><br></p><br><p>NB.. 6000 pallet spaces might sound a lot, but it will rapidly fill and realistically we will at some point close <a class="_str_" href="/register.sys">registrations</a>.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Edit.. at May 2021 - available spaces for storage less than 3000.</p><br><p><br></p>`
